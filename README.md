# node-vibrant
[![Known Vulnerabilities](https://snyk.io/test/npm/name/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/npm/name)

Extract prominent colors from an image.

`node-vibrant` is a node.js port of [Vibrant.js](https://github.com/jariz/vibrant.js), which is a javascript port of the [awesome Palette class](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/graphics/Palette.html) in the Android support library.

## Features

* Identical (asynchronous) API for both node.js and browser environment
* Support browserify
* Consistent results (*)

_* The results is consistent within each user's browser instance regardelss of visible region or display size of the image, unlike the original `vibrant.js` implementation._

_However, due to the very nature of HTML5 canvas element, image rendering is platform/machine-dependent. Thus the resulting swatches in browser environment varies and may not be the same as in node.js nor in another machine. See [Canvas Fingerprinting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_fingerprinting)._

## Install

```bash
$ npm install node-vibrant
```

## Usage

### node.js / browserify

```coffee
# Use in node.js or bunddle with browserify
Vibrant = require('node-vibrant')

v = new Vibrant('path/to/image', opts)
v.getSwatches (err, swatches) ->
  console.log(swatches)
```

### Browser

```html
<!-- Debug version -->
<script src="/path/to/dist/vibrant.js"></script>
<!-- Uglified version -->
<script src="/path/to/dist/vibrant.min.js"></script>

<script>
  // Use `Vibrant` in script
  // Vibrant is exported to global. window.Vibrant === Vibrant
  var v = new Vibrant('/path/to/image', opts);
  // ... same as in node.js
</script>
```

`minVibrantSaturation` | 0.35 | minimal saturation threshold for generating the Vibrant swatches, values should be in the range [0 1]
`weightSaturation` | 3 | saturation weight coefficient for determining each swatch, actual impact depends on other weights
`weightLuma` | 6 | luma weight coefficient for determining each swatch, actual impact depends on other weights
`weightPopulation` | 1 | population weight coefficient for determining each swatch, actual impact depends on other weights

`err` | object | Error (if thrown)
`swatches` | object | Resulting swatches

## Intentional Deviation From `vibrant.js`

* `node-vibrant` takes image path, not the image object as parameter for the obvious reason that node.js environment has no access to HTML DOM object.
* `node-vibrant` provides asynchronous API since most node.js image processing library is asynchronous. And the original `vibrant.js` workflow is asynchronous any way (though you will have to handle the image loading yourself, while `node-vibrant` does it for you).
* `node-vibrant` uses one single `opts` object to hold all options for future expansions. And it feels more node.js-like.
* `node-vibrant` uses method call to initiate image processing instead of constructor so that developers can use it with `Promise`.

## Benchmark

Run `gulp benchmark` to see how `opts` value affects performance.
